++++++++  NOTES  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Need to consider the fact the WP only supports 2 pages. The index page and "other pages"
    We need to template each page so they look the same other than the index page.
    Output may be possible by making our HTML CSS into components? Need to research this
    ****THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED RECENTLY, I HAVE SEEN THINGS ABOUT NEW WORDPRESS FEATURES****


All pages must have dynamic functionality
    IE players come and go, swap positions etc

    Fixtures differ week to week - have a dynamic h1 that displays the next match with a table below of past 
    matches with score and another table with upcoming games

    Chat options seem mundane, perhaps a link to a discord or something. Less work, easier to use for everyone



Fill in with dummy text / images to get the layout, then in wordpress 
    we can implement input and looping functionality for the main stuff
    IE - forEach({{ description }})



Try to lean on JS so we don't need too much php, the only php we should need is input
    / output functionality in terms of the WP "backend"

Blog is easily implemented
